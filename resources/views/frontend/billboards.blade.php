    <p><strong>Reach</strong></p>
    <p>Billboards reach an incredible number of people. Many boards on highways and busy roads reach thousands of different
        people everyday. There will always be a new percentage of cars passing your billboard EVERYDAY, increasing the total
        number of people seeing your ad.</p>
    <p><strong>Frequency</strong></p>
    <p>What results do you want from your advertising? Most advertisers want the audience to remember the name of their
        company and what the company does as most important. What generates recall more than anything is the number of times
        someone can sees an ad. Many people drive to and from work or other places by the same route everyday. That means,
        conservatively, they will drive by your billboard advertisement every workday 20 to 25 times per month! That&#8217;s
        a lot of frequency and is why billboards are the very best medium for generating recall.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t you want the most efficient form of advertising in your media mix? If you want to pay less for every
        person that you reach, then choose to advertise billboards. The typical cost per thousand people you reach, is KShs
        2000 /- or less for billboards as oppose to other mediums. Billboards are the most efficient and lowest cost of
        advertising found in the traditional media mix. Where else can you reach up to 3 million duplicated prospects in one
        month for only a few thousand shillings?</p>
    <p><strong>Market dominance</strong></p>
    <p>For a relatively small amount of money, no other medium can dominate a market faster or better than billboards. You
        can reach your entire audience in just days with outdoor advertising, making your audience think you are everywhere.
