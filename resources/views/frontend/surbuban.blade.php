                alt="4a" width="699" height="270" /></a>We hand pick the location of the suburban sign to suit your
        product for maximum exposure. The design consists of two sections. The first being at the top, allowing for a pay
        off message, while the main body of the structure gives you maximum space for your product. The sign is double sided
        with printed vinyl material on both sides.</p>
    <p>These signs are not only cost effective but are very good for crowded areas with highly populated pedestrian traffic
        and also serve well as directional signs for vehicle traffic.</p>
    <p>The sizes available are 8ft x 4ft.</p>
